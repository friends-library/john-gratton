== Chapter 2. Finding Truth

About this time I entered into a married state, and went to keeping house.
After some time, my wife grew earnest to have me go with her to hear a priest,
but I dared not, for I saw they were wrong as much as any, except Papists.^
footnote:[i.e. Roman Catholics]
Great sorrow fell on us, and we disputed often until we both wept.
In this condition I met with great temptation, and the enemy sought my ruin,
both of soul and body--all which I kept secret.
None knew the deep sorrow I was under night and day,
for I had none to whom I could open my mind, except my wife, but I dared not tell her,
lest I should trouble her, and put her in fear concerning me.
Yet sometimes, upon close search, I found a little hope,
but it was very low and very small.

After a time a cry arose in me to the Lord: "`Oh, that I knew his will,
and what he would have me to do!
Oh, that I knew his people, and his true worship with which he is well pleased,
that I might be joined unto those that were joined unto him!
Oh, that I understood aright the things that belong to my peace!`"
When I awoke in the morning, a secret cry arose in my heart:
"`Oh, that this day may be my birthday!`"
For I saw that I needed to be born again, and to be made a new creature,
and my exercise was very great.
No comfort could I find in anything that this world
afforded without the enjoyment of his presence.
For this I travailed in spirit before the Lord,
and had some hopes he would show mercy to me, which, blessed be his name,
I do now witness.
For in his own time he caused the Spirit of his Son to
arise in my heart with true power and efficacy,
and I clearly saw it was the Spirit of God indeed which I had so long grieved.
This begat a godly sorrow in me, and then I came to it to ask counsel,
and it showed me the way of life, and gave me power to become a child of God.
Blessed be the Lord forever!

One day, in corn harvest,
as I was riding on the road to Sheldon in a deep exercise,
and taking a view of my condition, being in deep tribulation and anguish,
condemning and judging myself, it pleased the Lord suddenly, unexpectedly,
and unlooked for, to cause the Day Star to arise in my heart,
and the Sun of Righteousness to appear with healing in his wings,
even when the sorrows of hell seemed to take hold on me.
It pleased the Lord to appear in me, and to visit me with the Dayspring from on high,
in a very powerful and wonderful manner, in great mercy, goodness, goodwill,
and infinite lovingkindness.
I was, in my inward man, full of the power and presence of Almighty God.
Indeed his heavenly, glorious light shone in me so mightily,
that I may truly say it far exceeded the brightness of the outward day.
The eye of my understanding was opened,
and I saw that it was the Lord`'s Holy Spirit that appeared in me, and I believed,
and could do no otherwise.

Oh, then I was glad, and my soul was filled with joy,
because I had met with the Lord, who I knew was sufficient to teach me all things!
And he gave me to see that my sins would be remitted and forgiven,
in and through Jesus Christ.
Christ Jesus was now become my light and my salvation, and living faith sprang in me,
for I felt power and strength to believe.
I then saw and felt what true faith was,
and I knew that I had never before had this true living faith.
This faith was the free gift of God, for it sprung up in his power, and stands in it.
I also saw life eternal made manifest through Christ Jesus,
and I tasted the good Word of God, and was made a partaker of the Holy Spirit,
and was enlightened.
For the life was manifested, and I saw it, and I saw that the Son of God was come,
and he gave me an understanding to know him that is true; for he revealed himself,
or made himself known in me and to me.

Now my soul was quickened and enlivened in him and by him, in whom is life,
and I also heard him as the Shepherd and Bishop of my soul, who had come near,
even to my own soul.
And the holy Scriptures were opened to me, to my admiration and joy,
and I understood them far beyond what I had done before.
These became more sweet, comfortable, and precious to me,
so that I wondered how I had never seen them so before,
having read them so much night and day.
But now the Lord gave me in measure to understand them, for they were very plain.
And I saw that no man knows the Scriptures but those to whom
it is given by the Holy Spirit of him who has the key of David,
and who opens and shuts as he pleases.

I kept what I had found that day, and it was to me as the Pearl of great price,
hidden in my own field (though I had sought for it in diverse forms and professions).
And I now understood the parables of the lost piece of silver in my own house,
and of the little leaven that lay hidden in my three measures of meal,
which I saw to be my body, soul, and spirit.
I saw that this had long been working in me, even while I knew it not,
in order to leaven my whole lump with its own divine nature,
which was capable of being leavened into good by the working
of that good and perfect gift which had come down from above,
and was freely given to me of God.

For truly the sons of God were led and guided
into all truth by the Holy Spirit of Truth.
And it was he that made David wiser than all his teachers,
and did attend him from his youth, and enabled him to go against the lion, the bear,
and great Goliath in the name of the Lord.
And I saw that no man could be a child of God without his Holy Spirit,
and it was this which I had lacked the knowledge of all my days.
And I was glad when I felt and knew that I had it freely given to me.
Now my great concern was to mind it, and be obedient to it,
for this was my Master and Witness that would either excuse or accuse,
according to my deeds.
It was my Reprover and Instructor, which showed me all that ever I did, and no thought,
word, or action was hidden from him.
I was glad that I had found such a Comforter,
and that it was poured forth upon all flesh,
according to the promise in Joel 2 and Acts 2.

Great had been the work of this measure of grace in me,
which had come by Jesus Christ in order to make me a new creature in Christ
(my life, light, and salvation),
or to leaven me into a new lump, and work a thorough change in me.
For indeed, I had great need of it, being a child of wrath in the corrupt nature,
as well as others.
Yet I had not a clear knowledge of this measure of grace, for great had been my ignorance.
And though light had shone in my dark, ignorant heart,
and made all things manifest that were reproved,
yet my dark heart had not comprehended it,
or understood that it was the light of Christ which so wrought in me.
For we lived in darkness, and in the night of blindness, and sowed to the flesh,
and took pleasure in unrighteousness, and lived in pleasure,
having our affections set on things below, and not on things above.
Yes, we loved the world and the praise of men more than that of God,
for the love of God was not yet known to us,
nor shed abroad in our hearts so as to see or feel that it was his love.
I was in a profession of religion without life, until the Lord appeared to me,
and caused the light of his Son to arise in my heart,
to my exceeding joy and satisfaction.
But when I was brought to the knowledge of this
(which was the Lord`'s doing, and it was marvelous in my eyes),
my sorrow was turned into joy,
and greatly did I feel the love of God.
And great love arose in my heart unto the Lord,
and I was deeply sorry that ever I had sinned against him.
I felt true repentance given to me,
and saw that I never knew what true repentance was before.

Now I had such a sense and assurance of the love, mercy,
and goodness of God to me in Christ Jesus,
and for his sake (who had now become precious to me),
that if I had died in that hour,
I was satisfied of my soul`'s eternal happiness and peace.
Oh, then all fear of death and hell was taken away!
For I plainly felt my soul so affected with the love of God,
that I was troubled that I had ever grieved his Holy Spirit,
and great was my desire that I might do so no more.
I went on rejoicing with praises and thanksgiving, which arose in my heart unto the Lord,
my joy being great in him, and I was ready to think that my sorrows were ended,
and my tears wiped away.
A new song was given me that none could sing, but only he that had it,
and I was glad to feel the precious Truth in my inward parts, which God loved;
and truly he loves those that love it, live in it, and obey it.
O happy day it was to my soul!
I loved the holy Scriptures,
which were never so sweet and precious to me before as they were now!
I loved all people,
and greatly desired that they might be brought to the knowledge of the Truth as I was,
for I knew that it was the will of God that all should be saved.

Thus, having met with the Lord to my joy and comfort,
I felt that his Holy Spirit was rightly called the Comforter,
which leads and guides into all Truth, which I now rejoiced to know, feel, taste,
and handle.
Then I turned my mind in to the Lord, to commune with him,
desiring to know who were his people, so that I might join with them,
and worship him aright, according to his own will.
And the Lord in mercy answered me as I prayed to him,
and the word of the Lord was so powerful in my
heart that I could do no other than believe it.
And the Lord made known to me that the people called
Quakers were his people above all other people.
When I understood that this was the Lord`'s people, I felt a part in me that was sorry,
for if it had been any other people,
I might have been more at liberty to please the world, and to keep the friendship of it,
and not be so hated by it.
For this people were despised, persecuted, and suffered deeply beyond all others.
Others could flee from sufferings, and conform a little at times,
but this people stood and abode,
though the winds blew and the rains fell and the floods beat upon them.
For the Lord enabled them to stand and withstand it.
All praises forever be given to him!

I felt the Spirit of the Lord,
and could not question the truth of what he had manifested to me.
Only I observed in my mind that the Lord said,
"`The people called Quakers are my people above all other people;`"
not that they were his people only and no other,
but "`above all other.`"
So I concluded that there were many more who were not
called Quakers that would be brought to know him,
as I did then, and feel that he is good, and have his love shed abroad in their hearts,
and love him therewith, and one another for his sake.
I felt love to all, agreeable to that holy song,
"`Peace on earth, and good will towards men.`"
Praise, glory, and humble thanks to God!
For with him is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
far beyond what I thought I should ever have known.

There was a young man walking a little way off from me, and I felt a love to him,
though I knew not that he was of any religious society at that time.
But he was afterwards convinced of the Truth, and was a very honest man,
and his wife and three sons and two daughters were also
in time brought to the knowledge of the precious Truth.
Some of them remain to this day,
and one of them had his mouth opened to preach the Truth.

Seeing that I had such a clear manifestation of Truth,
I was desirous to do the will of God, and was afraid of losing the sense, sight,
and feeling of that which the Lord had in mercy given me the precious enjoyment of.
He was pleased to let me see that no man could take that from me, nor hurt my soul,
if I did not do it myself.
Oh, it was precious to my soul!
And so, though I had been offended with the people called Quakers,
I now called them Friends, as Christ did those of old who obeyed him.
I went on to my journey`'s end with my mind exercised in serious consideration.

But, as I came back, the world was set before me, and all I had in it,
and I saw I must give up all, and let all go.
And this was not all, but I was likely to go to prison,
and my wife and children might be brought to poverty.
But I put my trust in the Lord alone, who is all-sufficient,
and is the portion of his people, and the rock of their safety, forever, amen.

Though the enemy was busy with me,
I was concerned to feel the Lord remain with me,
to keep and help me to abide in him and with him.
And blessed and praised be his name forever, he did not leave me, nor forsake me,
though sometimes he hid (as it were) his face from me.
And when I trespassed or offended for lack of a diligent watch,
or allowed my mind to wander, yet he has not been angry forever.
Though his Word has been to me as a sword and as a hammer,
yet in judgment the Lord remembered mercy,
and the good Samaritan has come and poured in oil and wine, and healed me wonderfully.
Praise, glory, and renown be given to him!

My satisfaction was great, and my heart was turned to the Lord,
and my very countenance was so altered that my
wife and neighbors took notice and spoke of it.
But I kept my mind inward and said little, except as I had it given to me,
and I kept my exercises to myself for some time, and neither told my wife,
nor anyone else.
For as yet I had not been at any Friends`' meetings,^
footnote:[i.e. the Society of Friends, who were in scorn called Quakers.]
neither was there any about Peak country, where I then lived.

I met with some Friends at the market, and conferred with them,
but told them not of my condition.
The greatest part of the town was stirred; some said well of me, and had a love for me,
and some said ill of me, and hated me without a cause,
and they differed one with another.
But after some time, many were convinced and came to meetings.
The Lord having showed me again his poor, despised people,
it made me glad when I found those with whom I was to wait upon him.

After some time, I heard of a meeting at Exton, at one widow Farnay`'s house,
whose husband had been an honest Friend.
I went to it, and found diverse Friends who had come many miles.
And when I came,
I was confirmed that these were in that Truth whereof I had been convinced,
though they were so much derided by the world.
There was little said in that meeting, but I sat still in it,
and was bowed in spirit before the Lord.
I felt him with me, and with Friends,
and saw they had their minds retired and waited to feel
his presence and power to operate in their hearts,
and that they were spiritual worshipers who worshiped God in spirit and truth.
I was sensible that they felt and tasted the Lord`'s goodness,
as I did as well at that time; and though few words were spoken,
yet I was well satisfied with the meeting.
For there arose a sweet melody that went through the meeting,
and the presence of the Lord was in the midst of us.
And I met with more true comfort, refreshment,
and satisfaction from the Lord in that meeting than ever I had in any meeting,
in all my life before.
Praises be to the Lord forever.

I was assured that these were his people and were guided by his Spirit,
by which they came to understand his will,
and were brought in their measure into true obedience to his commands,
being made willing to bear his cross, deny themselves, and become fools,
that they might know true wisdom.
For this they wait in silence,
to feel the inspiration of the Almighty to give
them an understanding of the things of God,
which the natural man cannot understand,
because he does not wait in the Spirit for the manifestation.
I also felt such a love in my heart to them as I had never felt to any people.
Oh, it was true love, such a love as none knows but they that have it!
And I also felt the same love in them towards me,
and some of them got me in their arms and were glad of me, though I knew but few of them,
nor they me.

So I came home,
and my poor wife was sorely grieved that I had
gone among Friends (the people called Quakers).
The people of our town began to rage.
Some disputed with me; some cursed me (as I heard); some pleaded for me;
some derided and mocked me, calling after me, "`Quaker, Quaker.`"
When I heard them thus call after me,
my heart was glad and filled with joy that I was reproached for Christ`'s sake,
and was thought worthy to take part with Friends in the sufferings of Christ
"`that were yet behind in his body`" (Col. 1:24).
And the thought arose in me,
"`Now I have got the name; oh that I may be truly brought into the nature of God`'s people!`"

But there were several things that as yet I did not discern clearly.
Though I felt the Lord with me and was sure it was the truth, yet I intended,
in the secret of my mind, not to imitate the Quakers.
I continued to put off my hat to men, and to use the same language that I had done before.
For I did not like their plain language and behavior to people,^
footnote:[There were several accepted customs of
the day to which early Friends could not conform.
The common dress of the day was quite flamboyant, with an excess of useless lace,
ribbons, flashy buttons, powdered wigs, etc.
The normal greetings between peers involved scraping
the right foot backwards along the ground,
bowing low while removing the hat,
and then flattering one another with titles like
"`your Lordship,`" "`your Eminency,`" etc.
Early friends felt that such practices tended towards vanity, pride,
and the "`fleshly honor which God would lay in the dust.`"
Moreover, at this time in history,
the correct and plain use of "`thee`" and "`thou`" to a single
person was beginning to give way to "`you`" and "`your.`"
Most modern English speakers are unaware that the words "`you`" and "`your`"
were originally used only to address two or more people,
whereas "`thee`" and "`thou`" were used to address a single person.
In the 1600`'s, it became fashionable (again,
as a means of showing honor or flattery) to use the plural "`you`" or
"`your`" in addressing people of higher social status,
while "`thee`" and "`thou`" were reserved for servants, children,
or people of lower social or economic position.
Early Friends stuck to what was then considered "`plain language`"
(using thee and thou to every single person, and you and your to two or more),
rather than showing preferment by addressing certain individuals in the plural.
These may seem like small matters to the 21st century reader,
but it is astounding how many thousands of Friends were insulted, beaten, imprisoned,
and even hanged for refusing to conform to these outward customs.]
and I was not willing to come into the practice
of these things merely in imitation of Friends.
I then thought I should please people better if I said "`you`" to a single person,
and put off my hat to them (for many love to be worshiped,
though there is no worship due to any creature upon earth.) So
my coming among Friends was hidden for a time,
few knowing what I was, nor what I had seen, heard, and felt.
Yet I knew it was the Lord that met with me on the road,
and it was with such power that I willingly
received it to my great satisfaction and comfort,
and believed that the Lord (when he saw fit) would open my
understanding and give me to understand the holy Scriptures,
which, in his great mercy, he has since wonderfully done.

I was careful to hold fast that which was freely given unto me,
and it came into my mind to wait on the Lord to know what he would have me to do.
So I waited in my mind to hear what the Lord my God would say to me.
After some time, as I was riding on the road and waiting,
the word of the Lord arose in great power in my heart, saying,
"`Speak truth to your neighbor. Be not double-tongued; respect no man`'s person.`"
This fully satisfied me; and I saw I was to enter the kingdom of heaven as a little child.
I was to learn to speak and walk anew,
and I stood in need to be helped and held up by the secret hand of the almighty,
omnipresent God, and to mind him in all I said, and in all my walkings and doings.
I came to see that this had been the language of God from the beginning,
and the language of all righteous people in all ages, and that no prophet, apostle,
or servant of God did ever use any other language to him, either in prayer, praises,
or in their writings in any age.
I saw that God changes not, and that as men truly turn to him, they come to be true men.

But this language and manner of life was hard to flesh and blood,
which desired both to please men and to receive praise.
I had grown accustomed to such things when I was young,
and so it went hard with me to lose it all.
But I knew I must, though men took offense at me for my obedience to the Lord.
So I gave up in obedience to the will of God, in which I found life and peace to my soul,
and great encouragement and joy in the Lord.
Nevertheless, this way of speaking and carriage went very hard with me,
and was a great cross to my natural part,
and helped to lay me very low and to mortify the old man in me,
and made me willing to be a fool in the eyes of the world, and to be despised of men.

Now, blessed forever and praised be the Lord God Almighty!
He has made my soul glad, and satisfied the breathings of my spirit.
He has opened to me the mysteries of his kingdom, and given me a measure of his grace.
He has caused his light to arise in me and caused the darkness to flee away.
He has given to me the true bread of life,
and made my heart glad with the wine of his kingdom.
He himself has become my teacher, and has gathered me into his power,
and covered me with the banner of his love.
He has become my hiding place, my rock, strength and refuge;
I need not fear what man can do unto me.
He is my portion, I shall not want, and therefore I trust in him alone,
my helper in the needful time.
He has wrought all my works in me and for me,
both to will and to do of his own good pleasure.
He is a sufficient reward to all those who wait upon him.
He is all in all; I have none beside him.
He is all-sufficient; I am nothing but what I am in him,
therefore he alone is to be praised.
Glory is wholly due unto him, for it is he alone that has redeemed my soul from death,
and has opened to me the way of life.
He has taken my fetters from my legs, and has set my feet upon a sure foundation.
He has brought me out of the prison house, and has set my soul in a pleasant place.
He has plucked me like a brand out of the fire,
and has given me strength above my enemies.
He has redeemed my soul from death, and caused me to walk in the path of life.
He has heard my sighing, and my groanings were not unknown to him.
Indeed, the breathings of my soul he has regarded,
and my heaviness he has turned into joy.
Yes, he has tenderly waited to be gracious to me,
and his long-suffering has led me to repentance.

Oh, what shall I render to the Lord my Savior,
who has dealt so bountifully with me?
My soul, bless the Lord forever, and all that is within me praise his holy name,
for he has caused mercy to surround me.
Oh the lovingkindness of the Lord!
All you that know him praise his name, for his mercies endure forever!
He has caused light to shine out of darkness,
and manifested thereby those things which are reproved.
To this light my heart is turned,
and I am resolved to turn away from my iniquities and
serve the Lord with reverence and holy fear.

Now I know it was he, by his Word,
who showed me my thoughts and the intents of my heart.
Though I was once ignorant of it,
yet now am I assured that it was his Word which often called behind me, saying,
"`This is the way, walk in it!`" (Isa. 30:21)
He was still seeking to save me out of the enemy`'s power,
though I then regarded him not.
Nevertheless he pursued me, till at last my heart opened to receive him,
who is now my beloved, and has given me to taste that God is good,
whose goodness far exceeds all that this world can afford.
Praised be the name of the Lord!

I have found the Pearl of great price, the one thing needful for my soul to know,
and this is Christ within, the hope of glory, the true way to the Father,
who promised to be with his disciples to the end of the world.
This is he whom we are to hear and obey in all things,
lest we be cut off from among his people.
This is the anointing which I have received of the Lord, that teaches all things,
which is truth, and is no lie.
Oh that the children of men would open their hearts,
that the king of glory might enter in,
to drive out that den of thieves who rob them of that
treasure and peace which passes their understanding.
Then they would come to witness the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth,
to lead them into all truth; for it is he who works all our works in us and for us.
This is the Lord`'s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes;
to whom be praise and glory forever!
