== Chapter 3. Ministry Years

My understanding being thus opened,
I came clearly to perceive the Word of God in my heart,
which had wrought powerfully to my full convincement,
and by it I knew I must be faithful to its requiring if I would have peace.
For it gave me a true sight of my state, and how I should wait for salvation.

Then I did see,
to my great satisfaction (which caused joy to arise in my heart) that the
despised Quakers were the people who worshiped God in the way he required,
in Spirit and in truth.
And having come to see through all things to my satisfaction (in the light of the Lord),
I went cheerfully to Friends`' meetings, and was edified and comforted.
The third meeting I was at, the power of the Lord came upon me,
and I was pressed in spirit to declare of the Lord`'s goodness.
It was hard to give up to it, yet I dared not disobey,
so I stood up and spoke to the congregation
(an abundance of Friends and others being met together)
what was given me to understand concerning the creation of man,
his dominion, work, state of innocency, fall, and restoration by the promised seed,
Christ Jesus the Savior of mankind.
All of which was to the great joy of Friends, and to the reaching of the people.

At this meeting a woman was convinced who, with her parents, dwelt at Tides-wall.
They much desired that I would have a meeting at their house, and accordingly I went,
much people being gathered in the garden.
This was a town in which I was formerly well known.
After the meeting had been some time in silence, I was moved to stand up and speak,
which I continued for about four hours.
But my very countenance was so much changed that there arose a
reasoning among the people whether I was John Gratton or not.
In the time of my declaring, a woman who was a Baptist put a question to me,
which I answered so much to her satisfaction that she was convinced.
This woman`'s husband was a Muggletonian,
and when he came to understand she was turned Quaker,
he told her he would write to his prophet to curse me, which he accordingly did.
After which, Muggleton, by letter, sent me his curse,
the words of which are not worth mentioning.
But in answer, I gave him to understand that it mattered to me not at all.

The next first-day I went to a meeting at Matlock, where the informers^
footnote:[As was mentioned formerly,
the so-called "`Act Against Seditious Conventicles`" was recently put
in place against religious gatherings of five or more persons.
The fine was twenty pounds for the house, twenty pounds for the preacher or speaker,
and five shillings for each hearer.
One third of these fines was given to any person who informed against the meeting,
so that the nation was quickly overrun with greedy "`informers`" who
rudely and violently broke up meetings,
and dragged men and women before magistrates
with the aim of plundering their money and goods.]
and officers had made very sad spoil by taking away Friends`' goods.
Nevertheless, many others, as well as Friends, came to the meeting.
As soon as I came within sight of the house, I felt the Lord with me.
I went in, and it was very full of people,
and after some time I was moved to declare the testimony of Truth.
The presence of God was so gloriously manifest, that the people gave good attention,
and were so affected that the fear of man was much taken away.

At this meeting, some of the people looked earnestly upon me,
at which I marveled,
but I then perceived it was at a laced band which I had upon my collar.
Because of this I was smitten and sorry, for until then I had not thought of it,
ever since my convincement.
Friends in those days showed no appearance of pride in their apparel.
So I was not pleased with myself,
for I saw that the Holy Spirit did not allow any superfluity,
either in apparel or in anything else.
From a sense of this I took it off, and wore it no more;
neither did my dear wife ever offer to put it on me again.
For when she understood that I was troubled for wearing lace,
she took it off all the rest of my bands,
although she was not then convinced of the Truth,
(though some time after she was).

My being convinced was noised much abroad,
and many people disputed and conferred with me.
My kindred were sorely troubled,
and would have had me forbear the conduct and language that truth had led me into,
saying, "`We ought not to offend.`"
But I told them it was the little ones that
believe in Christ who ought not to be offended.
"`But woe to the world!`" said Christ our Lord,
for the world took offense at him without just cause,
and so they also do at his true followers who are given up to do his will,
and to follow the leadings and guidings of his Holy Spirit.
If righteousness offends the wicked, whose fault is it?
Abel could not help it when Cain hated him because his works were righteous; and indeed,
Abel pleased God, even though Cain was offended.
In the same way,
he that is born after the flesh hates and takes offense
at those who are born after the Spirit to this day,
and they think it strange because they do not run with them in
their carnal ways to the same excess of dissipation,
speaking evil of them.

But when Christ said, "`Woe be to the world, because of offenses,`" He said also,
"`that offenses should surely come, but woe be to that man by whom they come!`"
Now why do such kinds of offenses come?
So that those who are the tried, living stones, may be made manifest;
and that those who will not take up the cross
and deny themselves may also be made manifest.
For the "`friendship of this world is enmity against God;`" and,
"`if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.`"
So the cause lies here--that unregenerate men are known by their fruits.
Woe be to the false prophets, false priests, false professors, and hypocrites,
though they walked in long robes, and sounded a trumpet when they gave alms,
and prayed in the corners of the streets to be seen of men,
and made long prayers for a pretense.
For despite all this they were proud, and loved the chief place in the synagogue,
the highest rooms at feasts, the greetings in the markets,
and to be called master by men.
They were covetous and devoured widows`' houses.
They tithed mint, anise and cumin, but omitted mercy, judgment, and truth;
for they were not what they pretended to be.

The Sodomites offended Lot,
and vexed the righteous soul of him who entertained the angels of the Lord.
And they too were offended at him, but woe and misery came upon the wicked Sodomites,
but Lot was delivered.
Jerusalem took offense at Jesus Christ, who came to save his people from their sins,
and to finish transgression, and to bring in everlasting righteousness.
The Jews hated him without a cause--he that would have
gathered them as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings,
to save them from the devouring fowls of the air that would utterly destroy them.

In the same way,
Christ spreads the wing of his power over those that are gathered unto him,
to save them from the "`prince of the power of the air,
the spirit that now works in the hearts of the children of disobedience,`"
the "`roaring lion that goes about seeking whom he may devour.`"
But the church is safe under the shadow of the Lord, saying,
"`I sat under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet unto my taste;`"
for all his fruit is good.
But the fruit of the evil one is all bad, as bitter as death, wormwood and gall,
and so it will be forever.
Woe and misery came upon Jerusalem also, who would not be gathered or saved,
but instead rejected the holy and just One, and chose a thief and a murderer before him,
as those do now who choose to serve the devil before Christ Jesus,
the Lord of life and glory.

I went abroad much, and had meetings in several counties, such as Yorkshire,
Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire.
Many were convinced, and great joy and gladness, love, unity, and concord flowed among us.
My wife was not yet convinced, and I was in much sorrow for her, and so was she for me.
She disputed with me often, till we both wept, but still we loved each other dearly.
Then, before the second meeting at my house,
as I was upon the road one evening in great heaviness for my wife,
the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "`I will give you your wife.`"
At this I was glad and comforted, for I believed that it would be fulfilled before long,
as it accordingly was, for she was soon after convinced, blessed be the Lord.

At the next meeting one William Yardley came,
and after the meeting she discoursed with him a long while.
At last Truth sprung up in her, and in him also, so that he went to her and said,
"`Ann, God`'s love is to you,`" which, she feeling, gave up to obey it, and was glad.
Then our days were made more joyous,
and we lived together after this about thirty-five years,
and many friends came to see us, of whom we were glad.
We had an open house and open hearts to entertain the Lord`'s people,
and were glad he had in mercy fitted and enabled us to be serviceable to his people.
And my trade increased, for we had favor with God and men.

I was much concerned in preaching the gospel of our Lord,
and went to and fro to meetings.
Many people were convinced in diverse places, such as in Darbydale, Matlockside,
Ashover parish, Brampton, Harsdale, and in the High Peak.
Many and precious meetings we had as we got liberty in houses, and meetings were settled,
and many of my own kindred were convinced, who lived and died in the Truth.
I have ground to hope that my aged grandfather, who was about ninety years old,
was convinced and glad of the Truth in his old age, for he told my mother,
"`This is what I have been seeking for all my days,`" meaning the Truth.
After some time, I went to Derby, and got some meetings there, and at Little Chester,
and many Baptists were convinced in Cheshire.

Afterwards, it was required of me to go and visit the churches in Nottinghamshire.
I went to Nottingham, and found William Smith lying sick, a fine living, faithful man,
and brave minister of Christ.
It was revealed to me that he would be taken away at
that time (as I told Thomas Highfield overnight),
and the next day, after the meeting was over,
I went to see him and stayed with him some time.
Oh, he was in a sweet frame, full of love!
Indeed, life and peace were plentifully in him.
I left him in great unity, tenderness, and love, and went to Mansfield,
and he died in a few days, and left a good savor behind him.
His memory is sweet to me, and those parts had a great loss of him.
From there I went to Skegby, Hucknell, and then home.

After this,
the Lord was pleased to lay it upon me to go abroad
again into Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire,
which I was very reluctant to do, but I dared not disobey.
I went to Tupton meeting on the fifth-day, and to Boulsover on the sixth,
where we had some disturbance.
And on the seventh-day I went to Chesterfield, where we had a glorious meeting,
and some were convinced.
Oh, the Lord`'s power was over all!
From there I would eagerly have gone home again, but could not, and wept sorely.

I went into Nottinghamshire, and on first-day had a meeting at Worksop,
in a barn which William Bailey had hired.
His wife happened to fall off her horse and break her leg as she rode near Worksop,
and her husband came down from London to see her.
Finding that she was not fit to be removed,
he hired a house for one year for Friends to meet in.
I went to see her, and had a meeting there on first-day.
As I was at prayer, the officers, with many more,
came railing and raging up into the meeting, making a great noise,
as if they desired to frighten us.
But just as they came to me, the power of the Lord increased, and my voice rose strongly,
and they all stopped and turned back like men smitten, and went quite away,
not having power to do us any harm.
We had a precious meeting, and went away comforted.

The next day I was at a good meeting at Blyth, and another in the evening,
to which came John Seaton, one of the chief men of that town.
He was convinced, and proved a faithful man to the Truth till his dying day.
Many more in and about that town were convinced of the Truth,
and stood nobly in it through suffering times, faithful to the end.
The next day I went to a meeting at a town in the forest called Etalstall,
where I had a good meeting.
Many came to it, and some were convinced, particularly one John Kent,
who received the Truth.

I went to a meeting at Kersall,
and the priest of the town came and made a great noise behind me for awhile,
in order to stop me.
But I held on, and was sorry that he troubled the meeting, for it was in a precious frame.
At last I felt I must stop, and so turned to him,
at which time he offered to clear himself from the charge of preaching for hire,
saying he needed not to preach except when he pleased,
for he had an estate to live on if he did not preach.
So I bade the people, "`Take notice!
This man is his own master, and needs not preach unless he desires.
But the apostle Paul, and they that were sent of God were not so, for Paul said,
'`Necessity is laid on me,
and woe unto me if I preach not the gospel.`'`" By this I showed the
priest from his own words that he was no minister of Christ,
and that Christ was not his Lord and Master, since he could do what he wished,
either to preach or not preach.
So he was made manifest, and went away in a great rage, and his company with him.
The Lord was mightily with us that day, and we had a good meeting,
and were sweetly comforted, and received no harm by man.

Then I went to Akring and had a meeting,
and one John Auin came to it and was convinced, and was shaken wonderfully.
But though he trembled, yet he rejoiced and cried out,
"`He is come! He is come! He is come!`"
After this, he went home and met with high-minded professors, and disputed them much,
taking his Bible and going to and fro in the town.
But he ran before he was sent, and so came to some loss,
so that his relations sent him to me.
But when he came to my house and talked with me, he was finely recovered,
so that in a few days time he went home.

But his family and the professors about him disputed with him,
and he was zealous and discoursed with them till he hurt himself again.
Then I took my horse and went and fetched him away to his uncle`'s at Blyth,
where I left him.
He did well and proved an honest Friend.
After some time he went to London and was taken at a meeting.
His wife went with him before the mayor, who, in pity to her,
would not send him to prison with the other Friends,
though he was freely given up to suffer,
and was grieved that his wife came in the mayor`'s sight.
He proved a very sincere Friend as long as he lived.

The next day I went to a meeting at Ogston, which was very large.
I had never seen the like appearance before,
for the living Truth went through the meeting.
Many were reached, and the power of the Lord came over all,
to the joy and comfort of many.

I was also at a meeting at Long Clauson, in the vale of Beavor,
and there was a young man called William Marriott, who was full of life.
And there Sarah Brown, Elizabeth Doubleday,
Edward Hallam and other Friends were comforted together.

The next day I went to a meeting at Harby, and the day following,
being first-day, I went to a meeting at Crowston,
where the lord Ross (so called) came to the steeple-house which was near to our meeting.
The officers and others came to break up the meeting with a great noise,
as if they meant to frighten us all.
As they came up the entry, I turned my face towards them as I was declaring the Truth,
and the Lord enabled me to speak boldly, and his power came over them.
Before they came to me, they became silent and turned back,
like men smitten in their hearts, and in a little time went away and left us.
So we had a good meeting, praised be the Lord forever, whose power was over all.

The next day I went to a meeting at Broughton, at John Wilsford`'s,
where a Baptist came privately to hear, and was reached,
and confessed to the Truth of what I spoke, as John told me afterwards.

The next day I came to Nottingham, and had a good meeting there on the third-day,
and Friends were glad of me, and we were comforted together.
But a Friend came to fetch me home from there, for my wife was very weak,
and more likely to die than live, and it was thought she should scarcely live to see me.
I hastened home on fourth-day, and found my wife very weak, and myself much spent.
But thanks be to God, he raised her up again.
My mother was with her, but my father was not convinced.
And when he heard that I was abroad, and how things were at home,
he thought to come and chide me for leaving my wife in her condition.
But the meeting happened to be at my house the next first-day,
and my father did not come until that morning, and some Friends came in before him.
And since he intended to stay all night, he decided to wait,
rather than to fall on me in front of them.

When the meeting was gathered, I waited some time and then spoke,
and some of the chief persons of that town were present,
whose tears I saw run down their cheeks.
My dear father was so broken,
that he cried aloud in great joy of heart while he trembled, at which I remained silent.
Then my father came to me weeping before all the people,
and took me in his arms and kissed me.
The next day we walked alone and had much discourse, till he fell to weeping again,
and desired me to forbear and say no more, after which we parted.
My father loved me much, yet he never came into open obedience to the Truth.

I stayed at home some time, and oh the peace that flowed in my heart!
Indeed, it is the peace that Christ promised, and not that which the world gives,
who cry "`peace, peace,`" when there is no peace at all experienced.
But praises to the God of my life, his peace he has given to me,
and many thousands in this day.
Truly this is a peace that the world does not know;
neither can they take it away from us, glory to the Highest forever!
Oh, the love and life that flows here,
and the springs from the Fountain of living waters, in whom are all our fresh springs!
Feel it reader, in yourself!
Have you not seen it gush out of your rocky heart,
when Christ (the spiritual Moses) has smitten upon it with the rod of God in his hand.

[.letter-heading]
An Epistle to Friends

[.salutation]
My dear Friends,

It is in my heart to write a few lines to you before I proceed.
Have you not found (according to your measures)
this Christ of God to be what I say of him?
Oh, prize this immortal life that now stirs in you, and praise the Lord for his mercy!
Live in this life that frees from death; abide in it, and your joy will be full.
The world little knows your joy, little knows your peace.
Though you have sorrow, yet always rejoice; though you war daily, yet live in peace.
Let the peace of God that passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in one,
in that light of life which now shines in your hearts, that you may never fall.
Always keep low in your measures, and see that none look out,
or mind anything but the Lord, who alone is to be minded in all, by all, and above all,
as well as followed, obeyed and trusted.

Dear friends, keep in the innocent life, and this will knit you together,
and enliven every member, and quicken you all, and make you savory.
Then seasonable fruit will be reaped, and you will be a good savor to one another,
and this will feed you, and your strength will be daily renewed.
Yes, then the increase of God will be experienced,
and you will daily feel his love (which is better than wine) to make your hearts glad,
and to surpass the world`'s love.
This will rejoice your souls in times of adversity;
for many waters cannot quench this love.

Therefore, dear friends, all keep your minds stayed on the Lord,
and take heed that you lose not the things you have received of him.
All wait, in your measures, upon the Lord only, and expect nothing from man,
for he is not to be accounted.
And do not think to live on the manna that others have gathered,
but you come and be diligent also.
Take heed that the Lord not call for you when you are gone abroad with your minds,
about your own business.
Keep your habitation, and the Lord will keep you, even as the apple of his eye.
Indeed, "`Nothing shall harm you,
if you be followers of that which is good`" (1 Pet. 3:13).
All live in the true light,
and abide in it, by which all dangers whatsoever will be made naked and bare to you.
Yes, even all false spirits will be seen and tried in this true light,
and you will clearly know the mind of God.
If you all keep here and live in this, you will find safety,
and the enemy will not be able to touch you.

Therefore, dearly beloved friends, keep in the light of which you were convinced,
and by which you were converted and turned to the Lord.
Keep in that, for that keeps you truly humble, in sincerity and truth,
and so all feigned humility,
and all pretenses and false professors will be made manifest,
and your enemies`' strength will also be clearly seen, which is mere weakness.
Be not forward in answering questions put forth by the opposers of the Lord`'s Truth,
but stand singly in obedience to the Lord, and be as fools,
that the true wisdom may be preferred.
In this way the will the Lord will be done, whether the opposers be answered or not,
and your peace will be as a river as you hearken to the Lord.
For the Lord will plead his cause with all flesh by himself,
and his arising will be the scattering of his enemies.
Indeed, Babel`'s destruction will come upon her by the brightness of his coming,
and by the breath of his lips she will be utterly destroyed;
the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

So, my dear friends, all keep in your strength,
and feel the arm of his power stretched out to carry you on,
that you may daily know victory, and praise the Lord in his own sanctuary,
and declare of his wondrous works.
For with a strong hand he has brought us out of anguish and bitterness of spirit,
which we once were in by reason of our cruel bondage in sin.
Had not the Lord come to visit us, we would be in slavery even till now,
for none else was able to deliver us, neither was there any to intercede for us.
Therefore, his own arm brought salvation to us.
Now all keep in that grace which saves, which breaks the rocks,
and has often broken you even to pieces, and has made your earthly house to tremble,
and has filled you with dread.
Oh, remember his mighty works in the deep, and receive the law at his mouth!
Yes, hear it and do it; behold, it is near you, in your heart and in your mouth,
that you may not depart from it.

Dear friends, watch diligently, for in this furnace you will be tried.
But though you are allowed to be tempted,
yet the Lord will not permit you to be tempted beyond your measures.
Therefore, all keep in your measures, for there is your safety.
"`My grace is sufficient,`" says the Lord.
Therefore, fear not your adversary, for he cannot hurt you,
if you always fear the Lord your God, and live in his counsel,
whereby your hearts will be kept as clean habitations for his Holy Spirit to dwell in;
for stronger is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

From your dear friend and fellow-laborer in the work of the gospel.

3rd of the Eighth month, 1673

--

The Baptists were displeased with me when they
saw there was no hope of my return to them.
They often disputed with me,
and great disputes were had at Monyash between them and Friends.
But the Lord had opened my understanding, and also the holy Scriptures to me.
I wrote a little book concerning baptism,
and therein showed that no man had commission from Christ to baptize
with water since John`'s race was run and his ministry fulfilled,
making it appear clearly that the Baptists baptized without any command from Christ.

At this time Truth prospered in the Peak country, in Derbyshire,
and the word of God grew and was multiplied.
This is the word which God sent unto the children of Israel,
preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
"`That word,`" said Peter, "`was proclaimed throughout all Judea,
and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached.`"
This is the word which Peter preached to the Gentiles, namely,
Christ Jesus the Lord of all,
who is the only way to come unto God by--
"`For no man can come unto the Father,`" said Christ,
"`but by me,`" and
"`there is no other name given under heaven by which any can be saved.`"
For he is the fountain of eternal life which is
opened for all to wash in and be cleansed,
and for that end he has poured out his Spirit upon all flesh,
that they may have a part in him.
And truly, the cleaner we are washed (though it be in great tribulation),
the whiter will our robes be.

Now I came to know what the city of God truly is,
which I had read about in John`'s revelations.
It is the true church, which has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it,
for the glory of God does enlighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,
in which light the nations that are saved must walk.
There the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor, and
"`the gates of this city shall not be shut at all by day, and there is no night there.`"
Here nothing "`can enter that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie,
but only those who are written in the Lamb`'s book of life.`"

After this I went to Oxston again, where the informers were very busy.
Some officers came to our meeting, and as I was speaking in the power of God,
one charged me in the king`'s name to come down and be silent.
But I charged him in the name of the King of kings to be silent,
and also asked him if he did indeed come in the king`'s name.
He said, "`Yes.`"
Then I said, "`Did he send you? Does he know of our meeting?`"
He answered "`No.`" Then I said,
"`How can you come in the king`'s name if he did not send you?`"
And the man turned from me and went away, taking those away who had come with him.
We had a precious meeting that day.

After this I went to Great Markham,
where they stoned us as we rode through the streets.
Then a man came to our meeting furnished with rotten eggs (as I supposed),
for he came and stood just before my face, and flung them towards me,
but did not hit me with any of them.
Another time I went to Markham again, and the priest came and brought the town officers,
and sent them in to break up the meeting while he remained at the door.
The officers came in, and Friends made a place for them,
where they sat down and listened very quietly.
I was declaring in the Lord`'s heavenly power before they came in,
and they stayed till the meeting was done,
and gave no disturbance (except to the priest who
stayed outside the door to see the meeting broken up).
But when the officers did nothing to stop us,
the priest raged and said he brought them to break up a meeting in which they stayed.
So he went away angry, and afterwards we departed, sweetly refreshed and comforted.

I ran to and fro, and had many meetings both in the High Peak, Scarsdale,
Staffordshire, Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and Truth prospered gloriously.
I also had meetings in new places, such as Ashford, Longson, Tideswell, Bradow, Grinlowe,
Baslow, and Matlock.
There was a convincement at Bradow and thereabouts in the Peak,
and one Jonathan Fisher and his wife (along with others) were convinced.
We appointed meetings there,
and such a large multitude came that the house could not contain them.
Wherefore,
I went into the street under a great tree in the market place that was walled about,
and I got upon the top of the wall and spoke to the people.
But a company of rude fellows began to stone us,
and the stones flew about my head and rattled in the trees, yet did not hit me.
However a great stone struck and wounded a woman that happened to sit near me,
and the people came and carried her into a house, but she recovered after some time.
At last a man came, blaming those who threw stones at us, and got into the crowd.
But after he had stood awhile,
he too stooped to take up a stone to fling at me (as was supposed),
but one of his neighbors standing by, who for some time had been very attentive,
seeing the man who had blamed others about to throw a stone, struck him on the ear,
so that he let the stone fall and did not fling it at me.
This man who struck the other was convinced that day, and became an honest man,
and so continued until his death, for all I know.

At last Henry Jackson and Henry Roebuck came to the meeting,
and climbed up on the top of the wall also.
As Henry Jackson was declaring,
a group of young men came and thrust Friends violently off the wall.
Henry Jackson was heavy, and they were very hard set to get him down,
but at last they did.
I went down and spoke to one of them, asking him why he was so uncivil.
He answered, "`If we let you alone the entire town will be Quakers.`"
So I went to a part of the wall that was just before the greatest part of the crowd,
and climbing up, knelt down on the top of the wall before their faces.
All fear of stones or men was gone,
and I prayed to the Lord by the help of his Holy Spirit with a loud voice,
and the Lord`'s power came over all,
and the people came down in their minds and were still, and became like another people.
Then Henry Jackson had good service among them, and our meeting ended in great sweetness.
As we rode out of town some blessed us, and seemed very friendly and loving,
and never more disturbed me there,
though I have since been many times to meetings at Jonathan Fisher`'s house,
who lived and died an honest Friend, and left a good savor behind him,
and his memory is sweet.
Many were convinced there, and at Slackhall also.

We went sometimes over the East Moor and had meetings at Totly and Dore,
where some were convinced, and also near Beechief, where Justice Pegg lived,
but he never concerned himself to disturb us.
Most of our meetings were out of doors, but one we had in the hall,
and several in a large barn.
One first-day we held a meeting near Beechief,
which was at the back side of a house in a lane, and many came to it.
There came a high constable, whose name was John Stone,
who brought officers and a company with him on horseback.
While I was preaching,
this constable charged me in the king`'s name to keep the king`'s peace.
But the Lord`'s power and presence being with us,
I held on speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
So he sent one of his company and bade him go fetch me out.
The man came and laid his hand on me and began to tremble,
but he had no power to take me away.
He stood by me awhile as I continued my testimony,
and then left me and went through the meeting without me.
When he came to his master, he said, "`Why have you not brought him?`"
What answer he gave, I could not hear.
Then he took out his pen, ink, and a little book, and called to a Friend to assist him.
The Friend went to him to see what he wrote,
and he saw that his hand trembled so much that he could not write.

After I had eased my spirit a little, I was silent,
and gave way to Henry Jackson, my elder brother, who had good service that day.
The officers were very uneasy,
and John Stone rode away angry as though he would go to the justice for more power,
and the meeting continued.
He stayed away, I suppose, above an hour, and when he came again,
he had as little authority over us as before.
For now the people were so affected and strengthened
that they ventured to talk boldly to him,
and told him it was fitter for him to go and search the ale-houses,
and to take notice of drunkards and bad people,
than to come here after that manner to disturb such honest people as we were.
He fumed about awhile, and at last put spurs to his horse and rode away,
and took all his company with him.
So we had a precious time, and he had no power to stir us.
Soon after that this high constable died.
There were some who went away soon after the officers came,
but they have been poor ever since, but the Lord has blessed the faithful every way,
thanks be given to him forever!
He was with us from day to day, and from place to place,
and permitted no weapon or wicked instrument to hurt me wherever I came.
Blessed be his holy name forevermore!

Another time I went to a meeting at an old house near Whitwell common.
There the officers came as well, but I declared the holy truth amongst them.
After awhile they went out to consult what to do (as I supposed),
and I heard that one said to the other, "`He speaks almost nothing but Scripture.`"
So they were not willing to disturb us, but instead went away after awhile.
The Lord was with us, and gave us a good meeting, praises be given to him forever.

I was invited to a meeting not far from Newcastle-Underline, and there I went.
But when I came there I found that the house was too little, for many came to it,
and William Yardley^
footnote:[William Yardley (1632-1693) was another early minister among the Society
of Friends who travelled and preached the gospel in England for over 25 years.
In 1682 he purchased 500 acres in the newly formed Province of
Pennsylvania from his long-time friend William Penn,
and moved there with his wife and two sons.]
was also there.
So William and I sat down in the house,
but the parlor and the other rooms were also filled with people.
Then came a man from Newcastle with the aim of being an informer against that meeting.
He went into a side room that had many people in it.
When the meeting had gathered, I felt the Lord with us,
and he enabled me to speak so that my voice was strong,
and those who were in the other rooms heard plainly.
This informer took offense at some words which I spoke,
but he was a dark ignorant fellow (as all informers are,
else they would not be informers to hurt the Lord`'s people for their obedience to him).
His offense was so great that he was restless,
and he disturbed the people that were in the room with him,
though he stayed while William Yardley was declaring to the meeting.
I sat silently waiting upon the Lord,
and it pleased him to manifest to me that there was a man in another
room that had taken offense at some words which I had spoken,
and he showed me the very words, and I remembered them,
though no creature had told me a thing, nor had I seen the man.
But I was so plainly showed it by the Lord, that when William Yardley was done,
I stood up again and called out to the man, saying,
"`Whosoever you are that are offended at these words...`" which I then repeated,
and spoke fully to, and opened them,
making it appear plain and easy to be understood that the
words which I spoke were words of truth and righteousness.
The man heard me and was satisfied, and got up and went quietly away.

Soon after the meeting ended,
the people that were in that room with the man before mentioned,
came to me and asked me who told me.
I answered them that no man had told me,
at which they wondered how I should know so fully, and tell it so plainly.
And so God had the glory, and the man did not have the power to hurt us,
but went his way, and I saw him no more.
Thus were we delivered from the wicked,
so that they did not prey upon the righteous who trusted in God.
And for this end only I write these things--that they
who fear and love God may put their trust in him,
and be obedient to him, and valiant for his name and Truth,
and fear not man whose breath is in his nostrils, who is here today and gone tomorrow.

After this I went to a meeting at Blyth again,
and we met on the side of a highway, for the meeting-house doors were locked up,
and we were kept out.
But the officers there were loving, and watched lest the informers came in.
And when our meeting was done and silent and about to part,
then the officers stepped up to us, and walked away with us,
feigning as though they had broken us up.
They took some before a Justice and told him that the meeting had been silent,
and so Friends were not fined, nor were the officers blamed.
The officers took this course on purpose, to save themselves and Friends also.

We had many good meetings at Baslow,
till at last they cast Hugh Masland into prison at Derby,
and George Ellis and Hugh Masland`'s wife died.
One day two men came to inform against us.
They stayed the meeting quietly,
but afterwards went to Justice Ayre of Highlow to inform,
and desired a warrant to distrain^
footnote:[i.e. to seize property in order obtain payment of money owed]
our goods.
But this Justice was displeased and sharp with them, and bid them look after themselves.
For he said that if he found that they swore falsely against us,
or if he ever caught them in a lie, then he would have their ears.^
footnote:[The cutting off of ears (called cropping) was a form
of punishment in both England and New England at this time.]
By this, the informers were so daunted that they went away and let it fall,
and troubled us no more.

After this the priest of that town grew angry,
and gave a challenge in writing to dispute with me on three points.
First, he said there was no revelation in these days.
Second, that no man had the Spirit of God in him in these days.
Thirdly, that if I had the Spirit of God, then I might read in a book he had,
which was Greek.
He set a day and place to meet, and when the day came,
I met him in a house of Humphrey Chapman`'s, in Baslow, a civil man.
Many people of diverse sorts were there,
and when I had showed the priest`'s blindness about revelation,
he put his book into my hand, and said,
"`If you have the Spirit of God in you, read in this book!`"
So I took the book and held it till he had vaunted and made an oration to the people,
and then he would have taken the book from me.
"`No,`" said I, "`You gave it to me to read; first see whether I shall read or no.`"
So I took my Bible and read the Scriptures to the people,
and showed them how they spoke quite contrary to the priest,
and the priest quite contrary to the holy Scriptures.
For the Scriptures say that the Spirit of God is given to all, but not to all alike.
For to one was given the gift of tongues, to another the interpretation;
some were gifted for miracles, but not all; some do prophesy and preach the gospel,
but a manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for the profit of all.

I read the plain Scripture, but he did not know it was Scripture,
but rather spoke against it, till one that stood by told him, "`Man, it is Scripture!`"
So he was sorely despised,
and when he saw that he had plunged himself into a great deal of error, he was silent.
Indeed, he was made so manifest that one Benjamin Ashton, the justice`'s son,
came to him and took him by the sleeve and led
him quite away and left me with the people.
There were many Baptists, to whom I spoke awhile, and so the people stayed,
all but the man who went away with the priest.
We had good service for God that day, and were comforted.
Truth prevailed and the people were edified, and the Lord`'s power was over all.
Many talked of this dispute,
and the priests of the country were offended with this priest for challenging me,
and envied me the more for it.

Our meeting at Monyash increased,
and several priests up and down the country were angry and very envious,
so that I and others were served with warrants to appear at the next court sessions.
One Wilson, the chief priest of our parish,
was to come on a first-day to our town to give (or
rather sell) bread and wine to the people.
And those who desired none of it, he would still make them pay,
for he had formerly sent officers and seized my goods for it,
though neither I nor my wife had ever received anything from him.

The meeting was to be at our town that day,
and the priest ordered one of the church wardens
to go early that morning and call at Ashford,
and then take the constable with him to Justice Ashton (who a moderate, peaceable man,
one who did much good in his place).
The constable was given private notice and so slipped out of the way,
but the officer of Monyash still went as the priest had ordered him,
and desired the justice to grant him a warrant to break
up our meeting that was to be held that day.
"`What!`" said the justice, "`A meeting that is yet to be?
I will grant him no warrant for a meeting that yet is to be.
How do you know it is to be?
Had you seen the meeting, I would have granted you a warrant;
but I will give you none on such account,`" said he, or something to this effect,
as I was informed.

So the officer came back without a warrant.
Even so,
this priest Wilson came to our meeting after he had finished his forenoon`'s work,
and sent for all the officers in the town to come as well.
He brought his clerk also to act as informer,
for he desired to break up our meeting by pulling and hauling us out by force.
But when they had pulled some of us out and went to fetch more,
we followed them in again; and as some were forced out, others went in.
Thus they wearied themselves for a while, until the priest was going away.
But having got in again after they had hauled me out, my mouth was opened to speak.
And when the priest heard that I had begun to preach, he turned again and stood quiet,
and all was still till I had finished.
I spoke to the priest before all the people,
and told him that if he took himself to be our shepherd,
and believed that we were strayed from the flock of Christ,
let him then make it appear that we were in an error, and I would take it friendly.
But he said he came not to take the sheep, but wolves, and so went away.
But he left his informer at a back window looking in through a casement,
who confessed that the Lord was among us.
We had a precious meeting after they were gone, and a Friend went to prayer,
and praised the Lord that his presence was with us.
Nevertheless,
this informer went after this to the monthly meeting of
justices to inform against this meeting.

We had then the high constable living in our town, who was a loving, friendly,
moderate man.
He was sitting in the room when the priest`'s clerk came in to inform against Friends,
and so asked him what he had come there for.
The clerk then told him; but when the high constable understood his business,
he got up and put the clerk out of the room, and kept him out,
so that he could not inform that day.
It happened soon after,
that this informer went to shoot his musket (he being a
trained soldier) and it burst into pieces,
by which he was wounded and narrowly escaped being killed.
He then confessed that he thought it fell to his lot to
be so hurt for what he had done to the Quakers,
and that he would be done with that business if he could.
So he troubled us no more.

After this I heard that Wilson, the priest of our parish,
went to the justices himself and wanted some course to be taken with the Quakers,
to put down their meeting.
Indeed he was hot against us, but against me above all.
But the justices held him off,
telling him that they were not willing to have any hand in ruining their neighbors,
and desired him to take some other course than by informers.

Before these things happened, I was in great exercise of mind,
though I was willingly given up to serve the Lord, whatever I suffered for it.
In this exercise I was brought very low, being deeply plunged in my spirit,
until at a meeting in my house it pleased the Lord in mercy to break in mightily upon me,
greatly tendering my spirit, to the gladdening of my soul.
Then did my tears become tears of joy, for I rejoiced in the Lord,
for his mercy endures forever.
Thanksgiving be given to him, who failed me not in this needful time,
but supported and bore me up in these days of great tribulation.
At this time Friends suffered deeply in many places, both by fines and imprisonments.
Also the priests in their pulpits raged against Truth and against us.

In these perilous days I went up to London to the yearly meeting,
where I was glad to see such excellent meetings.
The first I was at was on Gracious Street,
which was so large that the court was almost filled.
In this meeting the Lord`'s power was with me,
though I had more of a mind to hear others than to be heard myself,
for there were many fine men present who have since gone to their rest.
But the power of the Lord came upon me,
and at length my mouth was opened in the demonstration of the Holy Spirit,
to my great joy.

In the afternoon I went to the meeting at the Bull and Mouth,
which was also large.
Before I got there, a woman Friend was declaring, whose name was Theophila Townsend.
She had a living, powerful testimony.
Notwithstanding, the rude people about the door despised her,
and spoke discourteously of her.
I pressed through them and got into the gallery, and after she was done, I spoke.
At first I directed my speech to those unruly men,
showing whom the Scripture said would not enter into the kingdom of God,
but said to them, "`It is likely you think God will be better than his word.`"
Then they were still and silent, for the Lord`'s power came over all.
So I turned to the meeting,
and oh the streams of life that ran through the living that day!
The next day I went to another meeting, and to several meetings following in that week,
and it was a precious time to Friends.

On the seventh-day I met with three Friends who
were going to see Lodowick Muggleton,
namely Robert Barclay, Patrick Livingston, and William Haglie.
I went along with them, only I desired they would conceal my name from him,
for he had received my letter but a little before.
When we came there, his wife civilly conducted us into a room,
after which he came down and looked on us, saying, "`Is any of you John Gratton?`"
But Robert Barclay answered, "`Are you a prophet, and need you to ask?`"
At this Muggleton stopped and said "`You are Scotchmen,
and I will have nothing to do with you; for I was recently cheated by a Scotchman,
one John Swinton.`"
This John Swinton had been to see this false prophet, and in discoursing with him,
supposed him to be a poor man, and gave him half a guinea,
upon which Muggleton blessed him.
But before J. Swinton went away,
he told Muggleton he believed that he was a false prophet,
upon which Muggleton cursed him.
For this he would not meddle with Scotchmen.
Robert Barclay then asked him, "`Why did you not then return the man his gold?`"
to which he made no reply.

Then I spoke to him, saying, "`I am an Englishman, talk with me,`"
and I put some questions to him, such as,
"`Why must all Scotchmen suffer for one man`'s offense, if indeed you were offended?`"
He said he mattered not.
I told him, "`This seems contrary to the nature of Christ Jesus,
who came to seek and to save that which was lost.`"
Then I asked him
"`How did you come by your authority? Did you see anything, or hear any voice?`"
He answered "`No.`" Then said I,
"`You have no validation for what you do but what you heard from John Reeve?`"
He said, "`No, I have not.`"
Then said I,
"`I perceive that all you have for what you do is only the bare word of a man.`"
He answered it was.
"`Then,`" said I,
"`Do you not think it would be a credulous thing for me to
venture my eternal salvation upon the bare word of a man?`"
To this he answered, "`You must, if ever you will be saved.`"
"`That is strange,`" said I, for I knew he lied and was a false prophet,
(praised be the Lord, who gave me to see him fully).

Then I asked him, "`Do you have power to bless a man after you have cursed him?`"
He answered, "`No.`" "`What?`"
said I, "`You have power to curse a man after you have blessed him,
but not power to bless him after you have cursed him, provided the man repent?`"
He answered "`No.`"
Robert Barclay then replied that it was
strange if he had power to curse men after he had blessed them,
for then, by the same rule he should have power to bless men after he had cursed them.
All this while he knew not that I was John Gratton.

Then spoke Patrick Livingston, saying,
"`I was with a disciple of yours at Chesterfield,
and she told me I should never have any more openings or fresh springs again.
But,`" said he, "`I have found her a liar every day.`"
Then Muggleton said, "`Did she curse you?`"
"`Yes,`" replied Patrick.
"`Well,`" said Muggleton, "`In confirmation of her curse, I pronounce you cursed.`"
Then another said something to him, and he cursed him also.
And when he had finished cursing he was so pleased,
that he said it did him more good than if a man had given him forty shillings.
Upon this I asked him what he thought of me, and what would become of me?
He answered that if I was careful I might do well; saying several times,
"`If you be careful, it will be well with you in the end.`"
Then I desired Friends to bear witness that this false prophet
says he has not power to bless a man after he has cursed him;
and yet, having cursed me before he ever saw me, he now tells me if I be careful,
I may do well, and it will be well with me in the end.
"`O, what a false prophet are you`" said I, and then I told him my name.
When he heard that, he was sadly confounded and made no further reply to me.
So we left him and went away.
This I write from the memory I have of it,
and have been large in the account so that it may be
seen how plainly he was made manifest to be a deceiver,
and that others may beware of him,
desiring that it may please the Lord to deliver every honest-hearted soul from the baits,
snares, cunning wiles and devices of the enemy of all mankind.

Soon after this, as I was riding through Islington, I looked upon the city,
remembering thankfully the good time I had had there,
and it was manifest to me that I should meet with a
trial (for the gospel`'s sake) before I got home.
Nevertheless we went forward, and came to Ware.
There we called to see Thomas Burr, and from there we went to Huntington,
where I had some relations.
At this place great spoil had been made on Friends,
for it was a time of great persecution.
We called to see a Friend at Godmanchester,
whose house had been sadly plundered for meeting together.
We passed on to Ives, where we stayed their first-day meeting, which was very large.
Friends had planned it to be in an out-building which belonged to Tobias Hardmeat,
though it fell by course to be elsewhere that day.
Here the informers missed us, though they intended to have caught us,
but being misinformed about our meeting, we were preserved out of their hands.

From there we went to Stamford in Lincolnshire, to William Collingworth`'s,
where once I had a meeting, and to Oakham,
at Joseph Holt`'s. From there we passed on till
we came to Long Clawson in the vale of Beaver.
As we walked down the hill,
it came into my mind that at this place I should meet
with the exercise which I had a foresight of before,
notwithstanding which, I was given up to the service I was called to.
We came to a Friend`'s house named Edward Hallam where we lodged that night,
and Friends came to see us, desiring us to stay and meet with them the next day.
I inquired of them how things were with them,
whether things had been quiet (for I was certain we should be disturbed,
yet I dared not deny a meeting with them, and so kept all to myself).
They told me as of yet they had met with no trouble,
but said the priest had recently made threats.
However, we agreed to have a meeting the next day,
and I told them it might so happen that they would be fined twenty pounds for me.
They answered, "`If you will venture, we will.`"
So it was resolved.

That night in my sleep, the Lord showed me the meeting in the meeting-house,
and let me see a company of great dogs come in and fall on us,
and rear up at us with their forefeet upon our shoulders, as if they would worry us.
One dog seemed to be upon me, and had gotten my left arm in his mouth,
but I lifted up my right hand and knocked him down, and down they all came and went away.
After this, we had a good meeting,
and we looked one upon another to see if any were hurt,
and no man had so much as his skin broken, so we parted.

The next day, before the meeting was gathered,
as soon as I came within sight of the meeting-house door,
I saw the priest and officers of the town with
two informers in soldier`'s coats going there.
I saw that they were pressing to get into the meeting-house,
and I was afraid they would get in before me and keep me out.
So I hurried all I could, pressed through the crowd,
and got in before the priest and officers.
Soon after, they came in and began taking names,
but they were so confounded that it was observed that
they asked for the names of their own town`'s people,
though they knew them all well enough.
After some time, the power of the Lord arose in me.
I knelt down and began to pray, so my right hand was lifted up,
and they fell and got away out of the meeting.

The priest and constable took horse and went about four miles to fetch a justice,
whom they brought back with them to the meeting.
Though the meeting had ended before,
the informers (by the help they had gotten) kept
us in the house till the justice and priest came;
so we all sat silent.
Then the justice asked, "`What is being done here?`"
After some pause I stood up and went before him and told him,
"`We are here in obedience to the Lord,
to wait upon and worship him according to his own will, in Spirit and in truth.
We have not met in any contempt of authority.
And though some of us have wives and children,
and some estates in the world that we could lose
(if it please the Lord to allow it to be so),
yet we dare not do otherwise,`" or to this effect.
He then asked me my name and where I dwelt, which I told him.
So he went on and took names through all the meeting,
and fined me twenty pounds for preaching,
and the rest five shillings a piece for hearing.
This was in the time called mid-summer, about the time called Michaelmas,
the feast in honor of Michael the archangel.
After this he sent up a warrant by the informer to Justice Gilbert of Locka,
and he gave his warrant to the constable to distrain me
of goods to the value of twenty pounds.

The night before they came, when I had lain down in my bed,
a great exercise fell upon me.
I waited to see what it would come to, and so it increased upon me.
I thought I was walking upon a very fine green place,
and saw a storm coming with a very strong wind.
Upon seeing it, I resolved to stand against it,
and so set myself in such a way as I thought to stand fast and not be moved.
But the storm came upon me, and took me up, but then I was filled with the power of God.
When it was over I considered the exercise,
and it came into my mind that it did not come to me for nothing,
and I thought the Lord must have something for me to do.
I felt him very sweetly with me, and so I said in my heart,
"`Lord what would you have me to do?`"
Then the word of the Lord arose in my heart, saying, "`Sell all that you have.`"

After this I fell to rest,
and the next morning I went to the quarterly meeting at Tupton.
When I came there, I heard that two red coats had gone up to Monyash to distrain my goods.
The rumor was that all that I had must be taken
from me for preaching the everlasting gospel,
for that was my crime, and nothing else; praised be the Almighty forever!
I acquainted the meeting with the exercise I had in my bed the night before,
and how the word of the Lord came to me, bidding me sell all.
Then I desired that those present give me their sense,
whether I should actually sell all, or give up all,
and let all go patiently and freely for the truth`'s sake,
if indeed the Lord was pleased to permit me to be so tried with the loss of all?
And it was the sense of the meeting that I should give up all into the Lord`'s hand.

At that time I owed money both to Friends and others,
which would have proved hard to pay on a sudden
without selling what I had in my own possession,
for I also had much owed to me, but I could not get it suddenly, whatsoever came upon me.
I owed most to Friends who were at the quarterly meeting,
but they came to me and were very tender to me, and encouraged me to give up all freely,
and if I lost all, they would be content to take things as they were,
or as it did fall out.
A precious day it was, and the Lord`'s power was over all the powers of the earth,
and I was strengthened; praises to our God forever!

I came home that night,
and the two informers had come to town with a warrant from Justice Gilbert,
it being certified to him concerning the meeting at Clawson by the said Lister,
called a justice (who never prospered since,
but rather wasted and went into a low condition and became poor).
The informers sent for the constable, who, hearing that I was not at home overnight,
refused to come till the next morning.
But early the next morning I sent for a man of
the Church of England to whom I owed ten pounds.
He came and I delivered goods into his hand to sell and pay himself,
and give me the surplus.
So he took them and was well pleased to see my honest care of him.
To another man I owed three pounds, but it happened he had a cow of mine in his grounds.
So I sent to him to keep her for his money, or to sell her and pay himself,
and give me the surplus.
Then, as for what I owed to Friends I was easy about,
seeing they had been so kind and tender, and gave up theirs freely.

Soon after this was done, I saw the constable go into a neighbor`'s house,
to whom I went and spoke.
Poor man, he was full of trouble, and wanted counsel.
When he saw me, he said to me,
"`You have brought yourself into trouble, and me too,`" and was very passionate.
"`Man,`" said I, "`I have done no man any wrong.
I would not have you be troubled.
If you will distrain my goods you may, but if you will take my counsel,
I will tell you what I would have you to do.`"
He asked, "`What would you have me to do?`"
I said,
"`Send these men away, and tell them if you need assistance you can call to your neighbors.`"
He was pleased with my advice and went up to the inn.
But before he left me, the informers came in, and they knew me, and said I was the man.
"`Yes,`" said I, "`How is Justice Lister?
I thought he had been more moderate than to have
prosecuted the law against me to this height.`"
One of them said, "`You are a people that will be obedient to no law.`"
I felt the Lord`'s power arise in me, and I said unto him, "`What do you think,
are we children of God, or children of the devil?
If the latter, you may take courage to do as you do (though I knew he ought not to).
But if you think we are children of God, how dare you?
But I will tell you one thing, the Scripture says that '`he that is born after the flesh,
persecutes him that is born after the spirit.`'`" "`So,`" said I,
"`There is your evidence.
And further, we read that persecution '`is an evident sign to them of perdition,
but to you of salvation, and that of God.`'`" The Lord`'s power appearing with these words,
they both were silent, and went away to the inn, and the constable also followed them.

I stayed a little and weighed in my mind what to do,
upon which I felt freedom to go to the inn also.
There I found the informers eating, and I talked with them,
inquiring about Friends at Clawson, how they stood,
and whether any shrunk under the pressure of persecution.
They told me that indeed Friends suffered deeply.
The constable and some neighbors were in another room, and called me to come to them.
When I came they said to me, "`Are you so mad as to stay with your enemies?`"
"`Ah,`" said I, "`We must love our enemies, and do good to them that hate us,
and pray for them that persecute and despitefully use us.`"
"`Ah,`" said they, "`It is well for you if you can do so, for we cannot.`"
Then the informers came to take leave of the constable
and told him they did believe I was an honest man.
They desired him to be as favorable to me as he could,
adding that it would not be hard to convince the town`'s men to pay it for me,
"`For,`" said they, "`We heard as we came up the country that he was an honest man.`"
Then they begged of the constable to give them some money to help them home,
for they had above thirty miles to go, upon which he gave them sixpence.

When they were gone, the constable came down,
and I thought he would have followed me into my house, but he stayed in the street,
hanging down his head very sorrowfully.
Some of the town offered to pay the money and then take it up again as I could pay it,
but I could not with freedom do it.
But while I was at the inn, some of the chief women of the town came to my house,
and finding nobody in it but my wife,
they (against her mind) violently took all the best of the goods away,
and carried them to a neighbor`'s house--on purpose to save them for us.
When I came home and saw the goods gone, I was sorry, and asked my wife how it happened.
She told me she could not help it, and where they had carried them she could not tell,
for they had decided to do it, whether she desired it or no.

I went outside and invited the constable to come in,
but he desired me to shut the door on him.
I answered him, "`No, for I had done no wrong, nor was I afraid of any man, and besides,
I was not free to shut my doors.`"
Then he came in and sat down in much trouble, hanging down his head.
After some time, we had some warm meat ready for dinner, and we invited him to dine.
He roused himself and ate with us, and after dinner he went and sat down again as before,
in much trouble.

At last I began to think what to do with him,
for no way had opened to him how to proceed.
Indeed it went hard with him to distrain my goods, and he seemed confounded.
Then I spoke and suggested he might write down whatever goods were present in my home,
and then leave them with me, for I would not take them away if he did not.
Then he might proclaim them at the market, and in the steeple-house,
and if anybody desired to buy them, let them come to buy them at my house.
This proposal he liked much, and did accordingly.
But when the people heard my goods proclaimed,
they wished sad things to whoever bought any of them, so that none of them were sold.

Soon after this the constable went to the magistrate`'s court,
and meeting with Justice Gilbert of Locka (who had
granted the warrant) and another called Sir Henry Every,
he offered to deliver them his warrant and his bill of goods that he had restrained,
and told them that he could not sell them.
Justice Gilbert said to him,
"`If you cannot sell them in Derbyshire, you must carry them into Yorkshire.`"
"`No,`" replied Justice Every, "`We have no need of that.
You granted your warrant,
and you have done your office,`" and then speaking to the constable said, "`And you,
good fellow, have executed your warrant, and have done your office.
If you cannot sell them, you can go your way home, and let it be as it is.`"
The constable then came home, and with great joy told me what had taken place,
and how he came off so finely, and that my goods were saved.
(Now this Justice Every was Chief Justice in that county and loved honest Friends,
but hated hypocrites, and was much against proud priests.
The Earl of Devonshire and his lady had spoken to him beforehand to be tender to me,
as indeed he was ever after.
And after this, when I was a prisoner,
he laid hold of every twig of encouragement till he got me out again.
For when King James put out his proclamation +++[+++for liberty of conscience],
some sought to hinder me the benefit of it.
But Justice Every spoke to the judge and got me discharged.)

Thus the Lord delivered me, defended and pleaded my cause in the time of need.
Oh his mercies were great to me at this time!
For he filled me with the Holy Spirit the day the informers were with me,
so that at times I was ready to say that if I had had a house full of goods to lose,
I could freely part with them all for the sake of truth.
For to us it is given on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him,
but also to suffer for his sake;
and truly all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.
It is cause of great joy when we are counted worthy to suffer for him.
He that loses anything for his sake, shall receive a hundred fold in this life,
and in the world to come life everlasting.
If we suffer with him, we shall reign with him; but if we deny him, he also will deny us.
They are counted happy that endure; for he that endures to the end shall be saved.
Therefore we are exhorted to lay hold of eternal life, and to hold it fast,
lest anyone take our crown,
which the Lord freely gives to all those who love his appearing.

After this sessions I was fined several times, twenty pounds each time,
and the constables always took the same course with me, going to see Justice Every,
who took their warrants, discharged the officers, and sent them home.
So the Lord preserved me from the spoilers, blessed be his name!
He allowed the enemies of Truth to go no further,
nor to do any more than he was pleased to give his
people strength to bear with comfort and rejoicing.
Truly, he has been my rock and stay, yes, my portion both for soul and body.
He has helped me in all my necessities,
and stood by me to hold up my head above all the waters and tempests.
Indeed, he is my salvation and my treasure which will never decay.
Praises forevermore be given to him!

After this I went to a meeting at a town called Whittington,
to which came the mayor of Chesterfield and two men who waited on him.
But the priest of the town (as they afterwards told us) sent two informers,
who followed the mayor into the meeting,
though he knew not what or who they were (as far as I could tell).
The mayor came simply and innocently to hear truth declared.
I was preaching when he came in, and he stood up close by me.
I was opening to the people the parable of the wedding supper (Luke
14) and how those who were invited made excuses,
so the servant was sent out again into the streets and
lanes of the city to bring in the poor,
the maimed, and the blind to the supper.
I was showing who these poor, lame, and blind were,
and how these that were wounded and lame and sick came to the supper.
The mayor asked me how they were wounded?
Without stopping,
I told him that they were the "`poor in spirit`" who received the kingdom,
and the wounded in spirit, saying, "`The spirit of a man will sustain him in infirmities;
but a wounded spirit, who can bear?`" (Prov. 18:14)
So I went on, and the power of God broke mightily through the meeting,
so that the mayor cried out, "`It is true!`"
When I was done, he went out and wept bitterly,
and desired Francis Davenport (the Friend who owned the house where
the meeting was held) to show him where he might lie down awhile.
He led the mayor into a chamber where he lay down and wept bitterly,
and he was very loving to me all his days after.
Nevertheless (poor soul), he was very rich in worldly riches,
and it was too hard for him to stand in a public profession of the truth with us.
Yet he remained under a spiritual concern in his mind to his dying day.

But though the mayor (I believe) neither thought to do, nor did us any harm,
yet the laws were such that I was fined twenty pounds again for preaching,
and the Friend who owned the house was fined twenty pounds also.
For the two men (previously mentioned) whom the priest of the town sent to our meeting,
went and informed against it as a conventicle.^
footnote:[i.e. a secret or unlawful religious gathering.]
Justice Barton of Dranfield, according to some ancient laws of the nation,
sent out warrants to restrain our goods without calling
us before him to hear our accusers face to face.
They took Francis Davenport`'s cattle and horses,
and went to Fleshly Fair and sold most of them before Francis and I could get there.
But after we came and made it known in the fair how they came by those goods,
nobody would buy any more of them.
One man, who had ignorantly bought some of the cattle, was sorely troubled,
and said had he known it he would not have bought them.

The officers my town had the aforementioned precedent,
and so took the same method as the former constable had done.
They took some goods away from me, but could sell none,
upon which the constable acquainted Justice Every, who bid them all to go their way home,
and let it be as it was.
Thus this justice stood in the gap, and, in favor to me,
stopped my goods from being sold time after time,
by which means I was preserved wonderfully from being plundered.
The goods they took out of my house were brought back again after the sessions.
Indeed my neighbors showed much love to me,
and were unwilling to have me hurt at any time,
so that the Lord was wonderfully good both to me and my family,
and was pleased to work for me from time to time.
Glory to his great and honorable name forever!
For indeed, I never lacked a bed to lie on, or beds for my Friends, nor food to eat,
nor clothes to put on.

About this time I went into Cheshire and had a meeting at Chester,
where I met Roger Haydock, Eleanor Loe, and Mary Warrel, of whose company I was glad.
In this place there were several men who had received the truth,
and yet through unfaithfulness had fallen away.
When I understood this I was sorry, and went again to Chester;
for I had no ease in my spirit for two days and nights.
I came there on the sixth-day of the week,
and at night I had a few words before the meal,
where an apothecary and his wife were at supper.
The next day I walked to and fro through the market with a great concern upon my mind,
but did not have an opportunity in the street to speak to the people.
The apothecary took me to his house, where both he and his wife were very friendly.
He also told me that the unfaithfulness of some in that city had hindered them,
"`Otherwise,`" they said, "`We would have come among you before this day.`"
I talked with them and then we parted friendly.

On first-day I went to Richard Smith`'s house to the meeting,
and sat down and stayed an hour or more before the meeting was fully gathered.
I then stood up and walked nearer to Friends (for it was a very large
room) and the Lord in mercy was pleased to give us a precious meeting,
and there was great brokenness of heart with many tears.
At the latter end of this meeting, Richard Smith spoke very tenderly,
and desired that they who had been unfaithful might amend their ways,
and do better for the time to come.
Yet, poor man, notwithstanding this exhortation, he himself, after some time,
did worse than he had done before,
for he wrote against Friends and against the blessed Truth.
However, he, with some others who opposed the Truth, were soon after taken away by death.

At this time,
King Charles gave liberty to the Presbyterians to meet together in authorized places,
and they acquired a great barn at Ashford.
I happened to be in the town one day and saw their meeting break up,
and there appeared in the street an abundance of people.
It troubled my spirit to see so many poor people led away by
those whom I had tried and found to be false apostles.
Within three days the word of the Lord came to me to go to that meeting next fifth-day,
but it was very hard for me to give up to go,
for there were many there who I loved very well, and who I believed loved me.
But the Lord was good and encouraged me,
and I acquainted an ancient Friend with the concern which was upon me,
and he also encouraged me.

On fifth-day morning a Friend came to me, and together we went to the meeting,
where the priest was preaching false doctrine.
My message to the meeting was that their meeting should fall and come
down before long (and indeed it did in a few weeks after,
and there was never a meeting since then in that barn,
though they had set up a pulpit in it and fine seats).
When the priest was done, I desired to speak, but before I had said what I had to say,
they rushed violently upon me, and abused me, hauling me out.
The priest looked pale and went away, though I charged him with false doctrine.
When I was out I declared to the people in the power of
God against their priests and their worship,
but none answered me in defense of their way.
When I had finished I went away, and soon after saw the word of the Lord fulfilled,
for their meeting was not to be found in all the country,
because they soon fled and hid in holes during those suffering times.

Another day I was at Wirksworth market and the people swore dreadfully,
at which my spirit was sorely grieved.
The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
"`Go to the market cross and declare against the wickedness of the people.`"
I was reluctant to go, for I knew many of them to be rude, wicked, drunken,
swearing people, and I did not know but they might tear me to pieces,
and therefore I took my horse and went home.
But I was followed with sharp reproofs and righteous judgments from the Lord,
which brought me into deep sorrow,
and I expected the Lord would not renew this concern upon me.
But the next time I went, when I was in the market again,
an exercise fell heavy upon me to go and warn the people.
This time I went, not standing to consult anymore,
and in the heavenly power of God I declared the Truth,
and bore my testimony against their great wickedness,
insomuch that the people were much reached, and wept aloud,
and no man had power to hurt me.
I stopped twice and sat down, and waited in stillness for the fresh motion of life,
and the Lord enabled me to stand up again.
When I had eased my spirit, I came away in peace and great joy.
Afterwards I came to my inn, and some followed me there,
but it arose in my heart to go out of town, which I did.
After I was gone,
I heard that one Justice Loe came to the town and sent to my inn to fetch me before him,
intending to send me to prison.
But the Lord delivered and saved me out of the hands of wicked men;
for this justice was a great persecutor of Friends.
Thus the Lord was with me and kept me wherever I went.
Oh, let my soul livingly praise his holy name!

About this time I went often to meetings, and I ran to and fro,
the Lord always helping me
(without whom I could do nothing, for in him all fullness dwells).
Many were convinced, and our meetings were greater and greater, and many proved faithful.
But the priests raged sorely, for I went abroad as much as I could,
and kept my trade going too.
My family also grew larger, and my care was great to pay all I owed to everybody.
I was often constrained to ride many miles after meetings to
gain my markets on the second day of the week,
but the Lord blessed me in every way.

Many Friends came to visit me at my house,
for the more I traveled and labored in the work and service of the Lord,
the more I gained acquaintance with Friends abroad.
I went often to the yearly meeting at London,
and there I inquired how Truth spread abroad from nation to nation,
and I was glad to hear from Friends who had gone in the love of God to visit them.
Our town`'s people thought that my commitment to Friends would break me, as I heard,
and they waited to see me fail in the world.
But when it did not prove so, but rather the contrary,
they changed their minds and said that the Quakers (as
they called them) gave me money for preaching.
Many such false accusations and slanders I patiently bore in those days.
Thus the subtle serpent, by his wicked and false reports,
labored to hinder the prosperity of the pure Truth.
Yet I saw no other way but to give up my cause, and the cause of Truth,
into the Lord`'s hands for him to plead it as he saw fit.

The priests,
seeing that the magistrates in that place did not like to persecute us,
put their heads together and obtained a warrant against me and two other Friends.
It so happened that I was gone to York and thereabouts in Truth`'s service,
and did not return home till the warrant was near out of date.
But the other two Friends were taken and sent to prison at Derby,
and were long kept prisoners there.

After this, they cited me to the bishops`' court, to which I went.
When I was called, I went up towards the high priest and the others,
one of whom was called the Register, whose name was Nichols, of Litchfield.
When I came near him he looked on me with an envious countenance and said, "`Are you here?
I thought to have had you in jail before now.
But,`" said he, "`I will soon have you in jail.`"
Then said I,
"`I have read that '`the devil shall cast some of you
into prison;`' but I never read that any prophet,
apostle, or servant of Jesus Christ laid any man in prison for conscience sake.`"
"`But,`" Nichols answered again, "`I will lay you in prison.`"
"`Then,`" said I, "`You will join with the devil.`"
"`Pray, Mr. Wilson,`" he said to the high priest (the same who
came before to our meeting to persecute us,
after he had been at his so-called sacrament), "`Will you not admonish him?`"
Upon which I expected some information and counsel from him; but all he said was,
"`I admonish you to come to church. I admonish, I admonish you to come to church.`"

I was amazed at their folly and blindness,
for I expected they would have labored to show me that it was my duty to come to church,
or that I was in error.
But seeing nothing came but, "`I admonish, I admonish, I admonish you,`" three times,
in order to make way for their wicked court to go on persecuting me for money;
I said to him,
"`Pray tell me, whether you admonish me for the good of my soul, or for the love of my money?`"
Nichols replied, "`I for the love of your money, and he for the good of your soul.`"
With this the people made a noise laughing,
for they saw it was money more than the good of
souls that they aimed at in that wicked court.
Then the Lord`'s power arose in my heart, and I was going to declare against them;
for I saw that the wickedness in their high places was very great,
and that it came from an evil, cruel, persecuting, selfish spirit.
But before I could speak they cried out,
"`Have him away!`" upon which I was violently hurried out of their court.

At the next court I was cited again,
and in the meantime summoned to appear at the court at Derby.
The bailiff told me that my Friends and I must go to the clerk of the court.
I told him we would not go,
for it was in vain to go to him unless we would give him money.
"`Then,`" said he, "`You must appear before the judge!`"
I appeared willing to do that, and told him,
"`It might do well to let the judge know how we
were abused by you and your men the bailiffs.
For you hurry us to court and to sessions because we cannot give you money,
and yet people of other opinions who do give you money, you leave at home.`"
"`Yes,`" said I, "`to my own knowledge, you let one man stay at home for a penny.`"
When he heard me so willing to appear before the judge and
reveal how they made prey of the people in the country,
he bid me get away home if I desired.
I said,
"`Then I must have all my Friends go along with me,`"
(for there were many of us together).
He bade me take them, and away we came home.
So these greedy men got no prey from us.

The next day I was cited to appear again before the Spiritual Court, so called,
(but it should rather be called the Wicked Court) at Bakewell, and three of us went.
I came from the Temporal Court one day, and went to the Spiritual Court another,
but they all missed their chief design for me.
These men were like the governor Felix (Acts 24:26)--they troubled me often,
thinking to get money from me.

After this I traveled hard, and went to meetings in many places.
One day, as I was drawing homeward through Derby with William Fallowfield,
having been in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire,
a letter from Abraham Morris of Lincoln met me, desiring me to speak to a wealthy woman,
who was about to put some Friends (who were her tenants) in prison for tithes.
I went to her, and after some talk with her, she grew very cool and moderate,
and ordered me to go to her steward, about eight miles from Derby.
William Fallowfield left me, and I went home from Derby,
and on the next day I went to see the steward, but he was gone to Brasson.
I went there, and he was gone to the hall.
I sent for him to my inn, but he would not come.
So I went to the hall to see him, where there were two priests, the master of the house,
and some of Derby, all of whom knew me.
I got the steward away from the others into the hall, where I discoursed him,
telling him his mistress`'s mind, and left him very friendly.
After this I heard no more of the Friends going to Lincoln prison.

I pressed on then to go home to my family, though it snowed and blew hard.
But when I was on Brasson Moor, the word of the Lord came to me,
bidding me go to Auldwark and help them.
So there I went, not daring to disobey.
There was no priest or steeple-house in that town,
and many were under trouble about religion.
I had some acquaintance with one John Buzston, to whose house I went,
and he bid me welcome.
I told him I had a desire to have a meeting, and they acquainted the town,
and at the hour appointed the house was full.
I was enabled to speak as in the ability of God`'s Holy Spirit,
and was powerfully carried on for about four hours.
The meeting ended before twelve, but some stayed till two,
and the man and his wife were convinced, and both their parents.
Also the servant man was convinced, who has since become a fine minister among Friends,
and twenty more of the town.
John Buzston said he believed all the town was convinced.
Many came to meetings, some till they died, some till they married.
Others went into America and did well, as I hear.

I also had meetings about the same time at Newman-Lays-Millen,
and a great convincement there was in those days, some of whom are alive to this day,
and continue faithful to the truth.
Indeed there were many other places where the Lord ordered me and went with me,
and by his own right arm did unutterable things.
Many were convinced, yes hundreds, I believe, who then came faithfully to meetings,
at which the devil was angry, and I was cast into prison.
